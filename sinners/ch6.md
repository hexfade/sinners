**Disclaimer:** I do not own Pokemon, nor any of the characters from it. I do not make any money from the writing of this story.

A/N: Chapter took longer than expected, mostly due to me writing an entire one-shot story on something else on a whim, heh.  



Note: Growlithe and Kirlia have a short conversation in this chapter. Obviously Growlithe's speaking can only be heard by Kirlia because they are both Pokemon; no weird English-speaking critters in this story, heh.  



Speaking of, I hate Meowth. Stupid incompetent little shit.  



Anyway...heh, Kirlia is such a fucking teenager. ^\_^  



All these reviews and votes are much appreciated! I will continue to try to respond to all reviews. ^\_^

**Chapter 6: Campfires and Sweet Dreams**  





The route was a man-made path that twisted its way through the lakes and forests that spread over southern Hoenn. Bordered by concrete walls on either side, it was originally made to provide a safe, fast path between the two major towns of Slateport and Mauville.  



However, over the years, the growth of fields along the path had been too fast to control; and eventually, wild Pokemon took up residence in the tall grass. Trying to mow down the fields now would be an invitation to be flash-fried by a few hundred angry Electrike and Plusle.  



Which is why Slash did not make very good time that day.  



He and Kirlia plopped down against a wall, exhausted and hot and glad the sun was finally going down. It'd been a long, long day; it seemed like every ten minutes another wild Pokemon had lunged out of the grasslands and attacked them.  



_Master, how did we do today?_  



Flipping open his Pokenav, Slash groaned in exasperation. "Well...we're almost halfway there...shit."  



Kirlia snapped it closed and put it in his pocket for him. _It is alright, master. We may still have a long way to go, but at least we got in some good training today._  



Slash nodded, as she was correct; she'd fought off several dozen wild Pokemon today, and with each battle she seemed to get a little more efficient, more powerful, more accurate. She also seemed to be developing further in her psychic sensory abilities; she was getting quite good at sensing an enemy's strength and using just enough energy to take it down, without wasting excessive power.  



"Not to mention we made a new buddy today," Slash said, running his hand over a new Pokeball on his belt. "We'll have to spend some time getting this Electrike adjusted to our team when we get to Mauville...don't want to try when we're so far from a Pokemon Center."  



_Yes, so relax, master. You should get some sleep._  



"So do you. I'll have Growlithe keep watch so you and me can get some shut-eye."  



They set up a small camp site in no time. Kirlia used her psychic powers to blast a clearing out of the tall grass and gather the plants into a pile; Growlithe ignited them into a nice, blazing campfire that would hopefully keep wild Pokemon away. Luckily, none of the local wildlife was particularly aggressive, so it was unlikely anything would be brazen enough to approach the site at all, let alone take on a Growlithe and a sleeping Kirlia.  



Piling a bundle of grass against the wall, Slash and Kirlia lay down together under the clear starlit night and tried to get some rest.  



----------------------------------------------------  



Far away from the warm crackle of their campfire, in the far-off land of Kanto, a dark and elegant man waited for his most trusted agent to arrive with the Sea Pearl.  



It had been a long and difficult effort to come even this far...how many of his men had been captured or killed in the effort to get the Fire Pearl? Fifty. Yet Kiako had managed to get the Sea Pearl single-handedly and with no effort.  



The dark man smiled. Hiring the red-eyed freak had been one of his best decisions in a decade, and the start of a glorious new rebirth for his organization. A few years ago he'd done a complete overhaul of the group, having the weaker and less productive members terminated (in both senses of the word), opting for a smaller yet infinitely more efficient group of elite trainers.  



Gone were the days of bumbling fools under his command...anyone who failed him knew the penalty.  



He pulled the Fire Pearl out of his desk, feeling the strange heat radiating from its surface. Five years and millions of dollars for this small artifact...and it was all worth it. And with the Sea Pearl on its way, soon he'd be very close to his goal.  



Replacing the Pearl and tapping at his computer, he continued looking into possible locations of the Sky Pearl. He knew that the relics were indestructible...it was merely a matter of intense searching. He had a dozen agents combing Hoenn for information, although, as of yet, nothing had come up.  



"Soon..." he whispered to himself in the darkened room. "Soon they shall all be mine...and soon the next phase can begin."  



A light, hesitant knock at the door. "Enter."  



The man who came in did not appear particularly frightened, which likely meant he had good news to report. This assumption proved correct.  



"Sir, we've found some information about the Sky Pearl."  



"I am listening."  



"Agent Sai reports that a strange green sphere, matching the description of the Pearl, is present in Fallarbor Town. Apparently a child found it in the mountains and is in possession of it."  



The dark man smiled. _Could it be any easier?_ "Heh. Excellent. You may go now, I shall inform Kiako upon his return. And tell Sai that he will be rewarded greatly if this report is true. As will you be for relaying this good news to me."  



"Yes sir! Thank you, sir!" The flustered agent walked out the door with a smile on his face, not expecting to get rewarded for merely delivering a message.  



The man lay back in his chair as the door closed. This was how a leader need to act...not just blindly handing out fatal discipline to those who failed, but also rewarding those who succeeded. A great leader had to balance praise and wrath; too much of either would lead to an organization that was either spoiled and weak, like his had been a mere few years ago, or one that feared to act and represented a potential rebellion.  



And he'd rather have ten men that he could trust than ten thousand he could not.  



Smiling richly in the dim dark, Giovanni closed his eyes, confident that very soon the world would indeed be his.  



---------------------------------------------  



As soon as Slash was asleep, Kirlia got up from beside him and walked over to one of the small puddle-ponds that dotted the route. She looked at her reflection with a critical eye, muttering to herself in agitation.  



_I still look like a child...what was I thinking? I'm just a dorky-looking little thing that doesn't even come up to his waist._  



She looked at the Trainer's Guide Magazine she'd found in Slash's pack, and sighed. The girls in there were so...well, different than herself, in...ways.  



_Yes, I need to try to stop thinking like this. I'm never going to be like one of_ _those_ _girls. Even as a Gardevoir I'll still be very different from a human..._  



Growlithe trotted over to the hunched figure, and barked quietly. She jumped, startled; she'd been too focused on her thoughts to sense his approach.  



_Oh, I was just reading, and checking to see if I look as dirty as I feel after all this travel, Growlithe,_ she said. While her direct psychic bond with Slash was only between the two of them, she could still communicate on a basic level with other Pokemon...they just could not share emotions or any of the other intricacies of a trainer/Kirlia bond.  



"What's that?" The flame Pokemon glanced over at the magazine, which was open to a picture of a female trainer in a rather small bathing suit. Kirlia yelped out loud and kicked the pages shut.  



_It's not...no, I'm not trying to be like that! I was..._  



"Then why were you looking?"  



Kirlia sighed, small fists hitting the ground in exasperation. _Okay, fine, I was just curious! I wanted to see what humans like in the opposite gender. Nothing weird with that, right?_  



Growlithe gave her a doubtful look. "Call me stupid, but I think you're curious about more than what attributes humans find attractive. I think you're wondering what **one** human finds attractive."  



Kirlia turned away in frustration. _You don't know what you're talking about. Why would I care what...any specific person wants?_  



"Hm, why indeed?" He gave her a fang-filled grin, and trotted back to the campfire, giving it another small blast of heat to keep it going. Kirlia frowned and put the magazine back in Slash's pack, laying down beside him.  



_Am I that easy to read?_ she thought to herself. _If Growlithe can tell, what if Slash can, too? If_ _he_ _had been the one to catch me, I'd just die of embarrassment...I need to make sure I don't act weird around him._  



Yawning, she pushed herself into the grassy lump that made up her and Slash's bedding for the night, snuggling against her trainer's warm back. Dim heat flushed in her cheeks as she felt his strong frame against her body.  



_He told me that love means being happy when you're just in the presence of someone...does that mean that I love him? When I'm with him, I feel..._  



She stopped her mental ramblings short. She had no idea how she felt with him. It was a warm, bubbly burst of joy that was different than mere happiness. And when Slash had been struck down by Kiako, his body pouring blood and not moving, she'd felt like part of her was dying, as well, dying of fear and heartache.  



_Maybe...maybe I do...but..._ she sighed, thinking of the large, full females that showed predominantly in that magazine. If that's what humans liked, then what could she ever offer her master?  



Sighing sadly, she cuddled against her trainer, fairly certain that the only love she'd get from Slash would be in her dreams.
