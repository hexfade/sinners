**Disclaimer:** I do not own Pokemon, nor any of the characters from it. I do not make any money from the writing of this story.

*   A/N: I found this chapter to be kinda...eh. I needed a transition before the next main point of the storyline...and I suck at transitions. Ah, well. Hopefully I will update soon, and get to the first gritty chapter of this story.  



Thanks to those who have reviewed so far, although I'm not sure if I can work McKnight's suggestion into this...lol.

**Chapter 2: The Calm Before The Storm**  





The black-haired man would have thrashed the impudent child, but he was already late. The readout he'd gotten on the boy's Ralts though...now that was interesting.  



He ducked into a small alley behind the Dewford Gym, and activated his communicator.  



Despite all the miles between he and base, the rich, dark, dangerous voice on the line carried to him as though it were on the same island.  



"Report."  



"I've searched all over this town, including in the cavern. Nothing of significance."  



A disappointed sigh over the line. "Have you anything else to report?"  



"I saw a trainer with a Ralts. I checked it out, and it had an unusual power reading, much higher than one of its level should have. It's got a ways to go before fully evolving, but...it could potentially be what we need."  



"Interesting. Keep an eye on that trainer...but do not let it interfere with your other duties. I am trusting you, Kiako...you have always succeeded where the others have failed. Do not disappoint me."  



"I will not let you down, sir. In any case, it seems the trainer and I are headed to the same town. I'll monitor him for as long as I can. Sensiari out."  



Flicking off his communicator, he casually walked out of the alleyway, seeing the kid board a small boat at the town's port. Smirking at the idea that he might just get the chance to take him down someday after all, he went to arrange his own ride.  



----------------------------------------------------------------  



"Raaaaaalts!!!"  



Ralts clung to Slash's shoulder as the small boat sped over the waves, squealing in a combination of fear and excitement.  



"You wanna go back in your ball now?" Slash asked, feeling her small hands grip his hair. She shook her head; while the bumpy ride was a bit frightening, she was starting to get comfortable perched atop of her trainer. Slash was also enjoying having the little Pokemon out of her ball, as well. She had always been a shy one, ever since he captured her, and he thought that some personal time might help get her break out of her shell.  



The two wandered over to the front of the vessel, where the old, rugged Captain Briney was navigating through the narrow route between Dewford and Slateport.  



"We'll be there in a few minutes," Briney said. "Whatcha headed there fer, anyway?"  



"We have a bit of business to do for Devon. After that, we're off to find the next Pokemon Gym."  



The grizzled captain stroked his beard. "Aye, that'd be in Mauville, I think. Old friend of mine, Watson, runs the Gym 'round there. Challenged him a long time ago, I did." He nodded towards the Wingull that was flying alongside the fast-moving ship. "Ol' Peeko, she didn't last two seconds against him, poor girl. Electric user. We tried because...well, we were young and foolish back then. But still, aye, even with a diverse team, ye'll have yer work cut out fer ya."  



Slash smiled at Ralts shouting at the Wingull that, remarkably, was keeping up with Briney's boat. "I think we'll do just fine."  



The old man nodded, but then a somber look washed over his face.  



"Listen, lad, there's something else I want to warn ya about."  



"What?"  



"Ya know of Team Aqua, I assume?"  



"Sure...they're the guys who destroyed the dam near Fortree City last month, right?"  



"They're behind a lot more than that, lad. Sabotaging canals, destroying irrigation pipes to flood the low-laying farmland...all in a quest to expand the amount of water covering the world."  



Slash didn't seem that worried. "But they're just crazies, right? What's the big deal?"  



"Lad, ye've got a lot to learn. They're crazy, yes...and that is what makes them dangerous. When they destroyed the Fortree Dam, three workers were killed, and twelve were swept away by the floodwaters. When they flooded the farmlands, millions of crops were ruined; it took a massive rescue effort to stop a starvation event unlike anything in our history. They think their goal is noble, but never did the lives of those people cross their minds."  



"Why are you telling me this?"  



"Raaalts!"  



Slash turned to Ralts, who was staring at Briney with eyes wide. He glanced at the old man, who was nodding grimly, pulling up a sleeve to reveal an old tattoo...one of a Sharpedo with the world in its maw.  



"You were..."  



"Aye. I spent some time with the likes of them, years ago. Helped them do some...terrible things," Briney said sadly. "But thanks to Peeko there, I realized that loving the sea and its inhabitants did not require the sacrifice of one's own people...and so I lived a different life."  



Briney nodded in the direction of the rapidly approaching Slateport shores. "There've been reports that Team Aqua has been active in the region lately. If yer in the area, I want ya to keep an eye open. And while I know ya hold much potential...should ya come across them, leave them to the authorities. Don't confront them unless there is no other option. Promise me, lad."  



Slash felt the gravity in his voice; the old man knew what he was talking about. "I promise. I wouldn't want to needlessly risk my life...or the lives of my friends."  



The boat sharply banked, skidding to a halt against the Slateport shore, the stern pushing a few feet into the sand.  



"Alright, boy, we're here. Be careful. And when ya face Watson in Mauville...tell him ol' man Briney said hi. And that maybe someday I may pay him another visit," he chuckled. Slash nodded and shook his hand, mildly impressed at the rough strength in the old man's grip.  



Hopping out of the boat and into soft sand, Slash took in the sight of yet another new locale; a dazzlingly-bright beach next to a beautiful sea, scattered with sun umbrellas, towels, and rafts for lounging...a small restaurant to cool off in...all nestled in front of a large city built by the water's edge.  



"Ralts, I think we're going to like this place," he said happily, and Ralts mewed in agreement. "Wanna get something to eat, little buddy? Can't have your lunch be ice cream, you know."  



"Ralts!"  



---------------------------------------------  



The beachside restaurant was small but comfortable. Customers' surfboards lined the outside walls; the inside was decorated with fishtanks filled with small Tentacool and Staryu.  



Slash slid into a corner booth and released his Pokemon, figuring they all deserved something to eat. Growlithe, Corphish, and Geodude were, thankfully, small enough to fit at the table with him.  



"How does pizza sound, guys?"  



All the Pokemon cheered happily, eager to have something other than basic Pokechow (which, while 'nutritious', tasted like dog shit). As soon as it was at their table, they all dug in.  



"So, guys," Slash said between bites, "the next Gym is run by an Electric-user. We're going to want to become significantly stronger before we get there."  



Corphish shuddered a bit, chittering frightfully.  



"Don't worry, obviously you'd only be fighting there as a last resort. Still, we should get you stronger before we challenge the Gym, so, in the event we have to use you, you have the best chance of victory possible."  



Growlithe finished wolfing down a slice of pepperoni, then gave a short bark at Slash.  



"Okay, here's the plan...Growlithe, you're on point. You'll go out first, because you're well-rounded enough to handle most enemies. Geodude, you're the main player here; Growlithe goes out first to ensure that Watson's first Pokemon is not a trick designed to take down Ground-types. We'll send you out if Growlithe is defeated."  



Nodding happily, Geodude was glad that, unlike in the battle with Brawly, he stood a likely chance to not be taken down in a single hit.  



"Ralts?"  



"Ralts, you're back-up for Geodude. If Watson uses something powerful against Ground-types, and Growlithe is already down, you back up the team. Plus, if you're paralyzed by an Electric attack, your Synchronize ability should help turn the tables."  



Chirping in satisfaction, Ralts reached up to grasp her straw, standing on tiptoe to take a drink. Slash smiled at the adorable creature, lifting her up enough to sip her water easily.  



Corphish grumbled something, and Slash patted its head. "Hey, don't be down on yourself. All of us have our weaknesses, and Electricity just happens to be yours. But you all have your strengths, too...we couldn't have beat Roxanne without you, Corphish."  



The small Pokemon perked up a bit at that, and reached over to his slice of pizza and popped a few anchovies into its mouth.  



Slash lay back as his team ate their lunch, considering just how happy he was now. Before he started on his journey, he was a lonely, quiet child; he and Growlithe (which he'd gotten for his seventh birthday) had been close, but he had no human friends, as his father's trainer career kept the family constantly moving and often made him feel as though he only had a single parent. But ever since he became a trainer himself, traveling across Hoenn, making new friends with his new Pokemon...  



Well, he was finally happy; and, like Ralts, he was coming out of his own shell.  



Growlithe had been with him for years, his only friend...slept on the foot of his bed every night, leading him home with its flame if they stayed outside after dark...a loyal Pokemon that would give its life for him. Slash ruffled its fur affectionately, feeling Growlithe happily rub its head against his hand.  



Ralts...ever since he'd captured her near Petalburg, she'd been shy; but as he'd seen at Dewford, she was powerful...and more importantly, she was developing a strong bond with him. Plus she was so adorable...he thought that maybe he'd let her stay outside of her Pokeball from now on. He didn't care that he might be made fun of, for having such a cutesy thing be his ever-visible traveling companion; she was his little buddy.  



Slash had never intended to capture Corphish...he'd been testing out a new fishing rod in the ponds of Petalburg, and suddenly found himself face to face with an angry little monster that he'd never seen before. Reacting on instinct, he threw a Pokeball at it, which, remarkably, captured it without a battle. Ever since, Corphish had been a loyal, albeit grumpy, member of his team, saving him from a loss at the Rustboro Gym.  



Geodude, his newest teammate, was still getting used to him; it fought without hesitation against Brawly, and seemed eager to prove its strength. It seemed to like sparring with Corphish, and despite the type differential, they always fought to a draw. Hopefully the rough and tough Pokemon would become another powerful and valued ally.  



Slash smiled at the hungry lot, realizing that, for the first time in a long time, he had true friends. Sipping on his soda, he looked out the window, towards the bustling Slateport City and the lands beyond...lands filled with wonders to enthrall one's heart...  



...and terrors to freeze one's soul.
