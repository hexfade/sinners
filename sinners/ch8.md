*   A/N: **YES, I KNOW, I AM A LAZY BUM WHO TAKES TOO LONG TO UPDATE**.  



But here it is! Sorry it took so damn long...heh.  



This is really the latter half of the previous chapter, so I suppose this should be considered Chapter 7.5 or something, but I'm gonna go ahead and call it 8 so the number scheme doesn't get fucked up, heh.  



In this chapter, Slash comes up against Team Magma, including their leader Maxie.  



Hope you enjoy!  



---------------------------------------------------------  



**Chapter 8: Playing With Fire**  





The three men and their Pokemon stood in the middle of town, their dark forms silhouetted against the rising sun.  



"The Pokemon Center should just be opening," Maxie said quietly, gesturing towards the large structure, the only one with lights shining in the dim morning. "Go there and take as many Pokeballs as you can carry. Do not engage in battle unless absolutely necessary. We want to avoid attracting attention for as long as possible."  



"Understood, sir," Ryu said, his Geodude giving a low grumble of acknowledgment. Fiakin picked up the steel case they were to use to transport the Pokeballs discreetly; in a best-case scenario, they'd walk in, fill it up with a few dozen electric Pokemon, and walk out, leaving the city without drawing an alarm.  



The quiet hold-up method was better than blasting their way in, maiming half the staff, and getting killed in the process, as had happened to a small team of Aquas recently. While the Magmas may have been unsuccessful in direct confrontation with their rivals, and less in number, their methods were certainly more efficient than the brute-force techniques that Archie employed.  



Not to say that the Magmas were any less willing to kill than the Aquas; on the contrary, the last major action Maxie had ordered ended up killing more people in a week than the Aquas had in a year. When a new artificial lake had been constructed near Lavaridge, the Magmas had poisoned the new water supply, leading to the deaths of over a hundred people before the cause had been discovered. The project had been abandoned, and the land refilled.  



Fiakin, who had personally been involved in that action, looked to Maxie. "Where will you be, sir?"  



"I'll be here in the crossroad, to handle any trainers that happen to waken and overhear any...commotion that you two make. When you have completed your goal, meet me here and we'll head north back to base."  



"Yes, sir."  



The two grunts and their Pokemon began heading over to the Pokemon Center, leaving Maxie to look out on the sleepy town, keeping a particular eye on the gateway that connected the town to Verdanturf; it wouldn't be any good for Watson to show up unexpectedly. Despite the fact that they would have a type advantage over him, Maxie had no desire to come up against the legendary Master of Thunder unless absolutely necessary.  



------------------------------------------------  



The nurse had just opened up the Pokemon Center for the day, and was still setting things up for the bustle that came with operating such a vital station in the crossroad-town of Mauville. With trainers coming into town exhausted from the eastern and southern routes, as well as desert-weary ones from the north, the Center was generally very busy throughout the day...so she was enjoying the early-morning calm before the storm.  



Relieving the overnight emergency nurse, she checked on the intensive-care Pokemon first, switching IV bags and soothing the few that were conscious. Many of these poor creatures came from trainers who came against Watson and were suffering from the temporary paralysis that often accompanied fighting powerful electric-types.  



She then checked on the egg incubators, ensuring that the temperatures were still up and that the eggs that needed to be turned were being turned.  



Satisfied that the more dependent occupants of the Pokemon Center were doing well, the nurse sat down at the front desk, looking forward to a quiet morning before the the rest of the staff came in and the day's rush began.  



Suddenly, the solitude was shattered as two men burst through the doors, one clutching a soot-covered and unconscious Geodude to his chest, the other being followed by a frightened-looking Numel. She jumped to her feet and ran to their side.  



"What happened?" she demanded, trying to visually assess the injured Pokemon's condition.  



"We were training, having our Pokemon spar," the man with the Geodude panted. "His Numel accidentally let out more power than it meant to, and he was badly burnt...we were so far from town, and we didn't have any medicine, and---"  



The nurse cut him off and took the groaning Pokemon from his arms, racing behind the desk to put it in the emergency healing unit to stabilize it. Missing the slow smile that dawned on the men's faces as she turned her back to them, she suddenly felt the heavy weight in her arms shift, and the Geodude, fully conscious, pulled itself around her body to her back in a flash, and then used one strong arm to pin her much frailer ones to her body, and wrapped the other around her neck tightly.  



Unable to pull free of the rock Pokemon's powerful grasp, she looked helplessly at the men, and, looking at the dark look in their eyes, realized with a start that this was all planned.  



------------------------------------------------------------  



Ryu grinned as the soot-covered Geodude flipped itself from the nurse's arms, getting behind her and trapping her in its arms before she suspected a thing. Not a particularly bright one was Ryu, but his frightened, flustered act had succeeded like a charm.  



Fiakin and his Numel walked over to the helplessly pinned nurse while Ryu watched the door.  



"Okay, listen closely," Fiakin said in a calm, controlled voice. "You will give us access to the Center's Pokemon storage immediately, or my friend's Geodude will snap your neck like a twig. Do you understand me?"  



Fighting to get air, the nurse glared at the man, seeing the tattoo on his arm: a Camerupt with its front legs atop of the world. "You're with Team Magma, you bastard. I'd rather die than help monsters like you."  



A small smile formed on Fiakin's lips. "Yes, yes, I know you would. You'd give your life to protect these creatures without hesitation. Which is why I'm sure you **will** indeed help us. Because if you do not, not only will we take _your_ life," he gestured to the rows of egg incubators alongside the wall, "but we will destroy all those Pokemon."  



A flash of fear showed in the woman's eyes, and she looked down dejectedly. If it was a choice between losing her own life to oppose these...terrorists...she'd have gladly given it. But to sacrifice the eggs...  



"...fine. You bastards. I'll do it. Just...don't hurt the little ones."  



Ryu snapped his fingers at his Geodude, who released the woman's neck but stayed close by in case she tried anything. Walking over to a locked panel on the wall, the nurse tapped at the keypad, opening the storage room.  



"We only want the electric Pokemon," Fiakin said, and the nurse glared at him. The town's electric Pokemon were their most powerful; if the entire Center's stock of them were stolen, Mauville would be all but defenseless.  



Seeing her hesitation, Fiakin's Numel breathed a sharp exhale of intense heat at her legs, making the fabric of her dress smolder and giving her a rush of pain. Tears starting to well up in her eyes, she led the Magma to the storage rack of electric-types. Opening the large steel case he'd brought with him, Fiakin began gathering the Pokeballs.  



Ryu suddenly shouted back at them. "A trainer is coming! He came from the south, so Maxie didn't see him. What do we do?"  



Fiakin paused, remembering that this operation was to be as quiet as possible. It would not do to have to battle someone and risk waking up the entire town.  



"You," he gestured to the nurse, "get behind the desk. Get the trainer out of here as soon as possible. Tell him the computers are down and that you can only hand out basic first-aid kits. If you try to warn him that we're here...he'll die, along with you and the eggs."  



Frightened and angry, she nodded, returning to her desk. Ryu followed her and crouched behind the desk, out of sight to anyone on the other side unless the trainer leaned over it. His Geodude was with him, gripping the woman's legs tightly, threatening to break them if she said a word out of plan.  



Closing the storage room door, Fiakin and his Numel continued to fill the case full of Pokeballs...wanting to avoid battle, but prepared to do so if there was no choice.  



------------------------------------------------------  



Slash and Kirlia finally arrived at Mauville as the sun was just beginning to shine over the treetops. Looking around, he saw nothing that appeared overtly threatening; in fact, the entire town appeared to still be asleep. In the intersection of the town, there was a trainer resting against a signpost; that was the extent of the visible activity.  



"Kirlia...do you still sense that ominous feeling?" he asked quietly, making sure he had ready access to his Pokeballs.  



_Yes, master...but it's still just as vague. I can't sense any specific threat._  



Considering, Slash turned to the town's Pokemon Center. "Well, if we don't have any leads on what the problem is, we may as well get a quick healing before we take a look around. You're still a bit winded from all that fighting yesterday, aren't you?"  



Staying close by her trainer's side as they began to head to the red-roofed building, she nodded. _I'm not injured, but using my powers so much has my reserves rather low. And if there is danger here..._ she looked around again, cursing her lack of ability to sense precisely where the threat was, _I want to be at full potential_.  



As the pair entered the Center, Kirlia suddenly felt the dark sensation increase tenfold; not wanting to attract attention from the lone nurse, she silently sent the feeling to Slash over their bond, who sent back a neutral acknowledgment that he received it. Nothing appeared amiss, but...Slash had a feeling he was missing something.  



"We're just here for a quick heal-up for my Kirlia," Slash told the nurse. The look in her eyes worried him; it appeared she'd been crying recently, and there was a hint of fear in them as well.  



"I'm terribly sorry, but our main computers are down. We're trying to get them fixed as soon as possible, but for now, all I can offer are first-aid kits for emergencies," she said in the calmest voice she could manage. Again, Slash took note of the slightly hoarse tone in her voice, and noticed the distinct smell of charred fabric in the air.  



Looking around, trying not to reveal his concern, he noticed that they were utterly alone. "I don't see anyone working on the computers..."  



"Oh, they're coming soon. But if you don't need any emergency care, I'm afraid you'll have to leave," the woman said, feeling the Geodude's grip on her legs tighten slightly.  



Kirlia couldn't sense it perfectly, but she felt a hint of the fear that was permeating the nurse's aura. She was lying, yes...even her master, without psychic powers, had figured that out...but not out of direct malice. It was out of terror.  



Sending that feeling to Slash as well, she began to center her energy, keeping it ready just below the surface in case she needed it.  



The sensation Kirlia showed him, as well as noting the ash that covered the front of the nurse's dress, as well as a bruise starting to form on her throat, made Slash no longer able to resist his questioning her. "Are you sure you're alright, miss? You seem...flustered."  



"Oh yes, I'm fine. Just a bit upset that the computers failed is all."  



Suddenly, Kirlia sensed it clearly; the fog that obscured her vision lifted. _Master, there's someone in the back...and a Pokemon, too!_ She scanned the room they were in, and was shocked to find the same thing there, as well. _Also in this room! We're not alone!_  



Slash nodded to her, casually putting a hand near his belt of Pokeballs. "Miss, I'm pretty handy with computers. If you'd like, I could give them a look and see what I could do---"  



Before she could formulate another half-hearted response, Ryu was leaping to his feet, his Geodude hopping to the desktop. Slash took a step back into a defensive position, Kirlia jumping in front of him.  



"You stupid brat! I've had enough of this! Geodude, take him down!" Ryu shouted. The Geodude lunged at him, attempting a powerful tackle, but suddenly found itself flying across the room at the hands of a powerful blast of psychic energy.  



While Ryu was stunned at the sight, the nurse ran over to Slash's side, unable to hold back her frightened tears any longer. Slash grabbed her hand, reassuring her, but keeping his eyes on the man and the stunned Geodude.  



"Go get help," Slash said evenly. "Find Watson, he---"  



"Watson isn't here, he's in Verdanturf!"  



"Then go round up as many trainers as you can." Slash and Kirlia braced themselves as the Geodude began to stir. "We'll hold them off."  



Nodding, the nurse started to leave, then turned back to him. "There's another one in the back with a Numel, raiding the Pokemon Storage. You've got to stop him before they steal the town's electric Pokemon."  



"I know," Slash said, although he was unsure why the Magmas would be after electric Pokemon; the solution hadn't clicked yet. "Just go get some help for us. I don't know if we can stop them alone."  



As the nurse ran out of the Pokemon Center, Slash glared at the Magma and his Pokemon. "So, two of you, huh? And a Geodude and a Numel?"  



"We're more than enough to take you down, punk!" Ryu spat, his Geodude preparing to attack again, bulking itself up to maximum power.  



Slash merely smiled, pulling a ball from his belt. "I wouldn't be so sure about that. Corphish, come on!" A flash of light, and the fully awake and fully fresh water Pokemon was out, its small size betraying the fighting spirit within.  



Ryu's confident look wore down a bit at the sight of a water Pokemon; he knew that his Geodude, and Fiakin's Numel, would be terribly vulnerable to it. Nonetheless, he had his orders.  



"Geodude, Take Down!"  



The rock Pokemon lunged at them, and Corphish struck hard, leaping over the attack and firing a blast of water straight down. Geodude roared in agony, and was sent flying by another Psywave from Kirlia. It struck the wall with impressive speed, cracking it and sending out a cloud of dust.  



At the tremendous thud, Fiakin came running out of the storage room with Numel at his side and a case of over a hundred stolen Pokemon in his hand. Before he could even take in the scene, another Water Gun had sent his Numel into a screeching frenzy of pain, rendering it unable to battle in a single shot.  



Slash looked at the two bewildered men and sighed. "You know, I was actually worried for a second...but you both are pathetic!"  



_Neither of them have any more Pokemon, master,_ Kirlia said. _But I'm still getting that dark feeling. I just can't tell what the source is..._  



Eyes widening a bit at that, Slash looked around the Center's lobby, trying to see if anything else was amiss. Nothing appeared to be wrong, but...  



"You stupid punk, you're going to pay for this!" Ryu growled, withdrawing Geodude back into its Pokeball. Fiakin did the same for Numel, but did not drop the case. Neither did his eyes portray any fear of Slash.  



"You. Numel guy. Put the case down and slide it over to me."  



"I will most certainly not."  



Slash's eyes narrowed. "Look around. I don't think you're in any position to disobey me."  



Fiakin smirked. "Is that so?"  



_Master..._  



"Of course. I was able to beat both of you with ease. Corphish and Kirlia didn't even take a scratch. Not to mention that nurse will be back any time now with every trainer in the village."  



Suddenly, both Magmas seemed to relax significantly. Ryu grinned brutishly. "No, she won't."  



"Really? Why's that?" Slash asked. _Damn, these two are arrogant,_ he thought to himself, not realizing that someone else had entered the Pokemon Center.  



"Because I killed her."  



Slash, Kirlia, and Corphish whirled around, and not even five feet behind them was Maxie, leader of Team Magma, with the broken form of the nurse under his arm, her pretty face now nothing more than a charred ruin.  



Once again, Kirlia felt the sensation of fog disappearing from her senses, and realized that this man was the source of the ominous feeling she'd been getting. _Master, be careful! This one is different from those two!_  



Maxie glared at what he saw, his two henchmen unarmed and with their Pokemon withdrawn. He knew neither of them were particularly strong, but did not expect a mere teenager like this to be able to defeat them so effortlessly.  



"You, boy. You've crossed paths with the wrong men."  



Slash glared back at him defiantly, his Pokemon standing on either side of him. "I take it you're their leader."  



"I am the leader of all Magmas. I am Maxie, and you...are in our way." He looked at Ryu and Fiakin. "Get those Pokemon out of here. I'll handle this."  



The two began to sprint towards the door, but Slash refused to let them get away. "Kirlia! Stop them!"  



With a flash of pale blue, a burst of Confusion slammed into the thugs, sending them stumbling onto the floor in an unconscious heap. Slash kicked the case of Pokeballs across the room, away from Maxie and the door.  



Maxie smiled at Slash's determined face. "Pointless, my young friend. I'm more powerful than both of those two combined. And I think you'll find that I won't be nearly as merciful as they'd be."  



With a burst of light, a massive Pokemon was by his side, a huge thing of burnt-orange fur and billowing smoke pouring from its back. Slash had never seen this Pokemon before, didn't even know its name, but could tell from its appearance that it was the evolved form of the Numel that Corphish so easily dispatched.  



And it looked like Maxie was telling the truth; he didn't think it looked anywhere near as weak as its younger brethren.  



"This is your last chance, boy. Stand aside. You can't win."  



Slash looked at the huge beast, then to his own Pokemon. "Well?"  



"Corphish!"  



_I will do anything you ask, master. My life is yours._  



"That's not what I asked," Slash said with a frown. "Do you want to?"  



_Yes, master. Together...we might be able to stop him. So we have to try._  



Nodding, Slash turned back to Maxie and his Camerupt. The huge beast snorted at the trio...  



And breathed fire.  



-------------------------------------------------------  



To be continued (in Flame and Thunder, Part Three).  



NOTE: Ryu and Fiakin getting their asses handed to them so easily is exactly what would happen if a competent trainer (aka, not Ash) were to fight Jessie and James in the anime. I mean, seriously...those guys suck. All three of them. Slash with two badges is already far beyond what Ash Ketchum could ever hope to be...that HAY YOU GUYS LETS USE THUNDERSHOCK ON AN ONIX LOLOLOL bitch.  



Let's go ahead and Earthquake a Pidgey while we're at it!  



:sigh: douchebag.
