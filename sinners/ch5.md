**Disclaimer:** I do not own Pokemon, nor any of the characters from it. I do not make any money from the writing of this story.

 
A/N: 1000 hits, very kick-ass, heh.  



Just a random note...this story will have a few fourth-generation Pokemon in it. I've never played Diamond and Pearl (I don't even have a DS, so when it comes out in the states I still won't have it), so if I make any errors, consider them to be artistic license, heh.  



In this chapter, we discover that, just as how Ralts would be the species child-form, Kirlia is the species teenage-form. And all that that implies.  



Also, we are introduced to the religious structure of Hoenn, which will play a major part in the story later. Parallels between the fictional religions and real ones are intentional.  



I heavily edited this chapter from its original version, to make it less...preachy. While it's still condemning of Jirachism, it's much more detailed, and shows Slash's own point of view on the issue---something which become very important in the future.

**Chapter 5: Dark Clouds and Soft Hearts**  





The next morning, Slash and Kirlia left the Slateport Pokemon Center, eager to continue their Pokemon quest.  



As the two headed towards the north gate, they looked upon the still-smoldering aftermath of the attack on the museum. Police tape still surrounded the damaged structure; windows were still being repaired, and a memorial for Captain Stern was in place near the entrance. While the streets were quiet and nearly deserted, there were hundreds of candles and flowers around the site.  



_It's sad...Stern didn't deserve to die. He just wanted the Sea Pearl to study it and teach others about history and science. Why do people like Team Aqua and Kiako have to do things like this? How can a stack of papers be worth a limb? How can a rock, regardless of its age, be worth three lives?_  



Slash sighed sadly. "Kirlia, my species is not nearly as pure-hearted as yours. We're more prone to...self-delusion. As easy as it would be to just write them off as crazy, Team Aqua honestly believes that they're in the right with their actions, which would be noble...except that they've become so stubborn and arrogant, they think their idea of a perfect world is so important that it must be imposed on the people by any means necessary. They don't care about how many are hurt or killed, because in their minds, it's...worth it."  



Kirlia made a disgusted sound. _That's terrible. How can they possibly come to think that, master? I've known some Water Pokemon in my life, and while some of them were concerned about their habitat shrinking, none of them would want humans to die for a few extra miles of water._  



"Well...sometimes, when a person is conditioned to believe something all their life...or if they're taught one point of view and not exposed to others...they believe that it is the only correct view. They don't let themselves question their teachings, and begin to view skepticism as unworthy of any consideration." Slash nodded at a tall, tapered building near the edge of town, with stained-glass windows and a statue of Jirachi in front of it. Solemn music, both elegant and haunting, flowed from the door. His next words were laced with bitterness and scorn. "Like the people in there."  



As they passed by the church, a follower inside looked at the window at the wandering trainer, giving Slash an angry look of consternation. Slash frowned back at him and turned away, grabbing Kirlia's hand and increasing their pace.  



_Who are they, master?_  



"They're Jirachians...it's the predominant religion of the land. Do you know what religion is, Kirlia?"  



_Not really._  



"It's a sort of...devotion to entities or concepts beyond science. Beliefs about things like the creation of the world, the afterlife, how to live your life...stuff like that."  



_What do they believe in?_  



"They worship a legendary Pokemon called Jirachi, and believe that by living in accordance with their holy writings and stories, it will grant them happiness and prosperity."  



Kirlia quirked her head. _What's wrong with that?_  



"Well, to them, it doesn't matter that there's no proof Jirachi exists...no proof that, even if it did, that it has the power or desire to interact with people...and it doesn't matter that most of the things they've attributed to Jirachi in the past have been described by science over the years. They're as closed-minded as the Aquas." He paused for a moment, heart starting to beat a little faster as long-held bitterness flowed through him. "You saw that guy shoot me a dirty look, didn't you?"  



_Yes. I could sense that he was mad at you, but...he doesn't even know you. Why?_  



"He was mad because I'm not in church today. Notice how the streets are nearly empty? It's the Festival of the Shooting Star today, one of their big holy days. Jirachians aren't fond of people who don't share their views, especially trainers. I don't care if he doesn't approve, though, I'm not going to put my life on hold to honor something I don't believe in any more than I would stand by and let the Aquas dictate my life."  



_I understand the comparison you're trying to make, master...but I don't know if it's fair to compare the two. The Aquas ripped a poor girl's arm off. That guy just looked at you funny._  



Slash frowned. "If all they did was believe in silly made-up stories, spent a beautiful day stuck in a stuffy building, and give mean looks at people who don't feel that way...well, I guess nothing would be wrong with that. Doesn't mean they're not idiots, and doesn't mean that they're not pricks, but...if they weren't hurting anybody, I guess it wouldn't bother me as much. But...sometimes they do hurt people."  



_What do you mean?_  



Kirlia grew a little concerned at the feelings she was getting from her master. Despite her hero-worship of him, she couldn't deny that his emotions towards Jirachism were almost identical to those that came from the man who eyed them unkindly. Different sides of the spectrum, maybe, but the bitterness was incredibly similar.  



"Their beliefs include some views that are rather discriminatory...views I would call outdated. One of the biggest problems I have with them, for example, is that they're against gay marriage and homosexuality in general."  



At Kirlia's confused look, Slash flushed and explained. "It's, uh...attraction between people of the same gender. They're pretty vocal about their views on that, complaining and protesting whenever some 'gay-friendly' law is being considered. They don't run the government, but their numbers and influence are great enough to make some lawmakers too scared to oppose them. Because of them, gay people still can't marry. They came close a few years back, but then the Jirachians blitzed Hoenn with a rant-storm the likes of which I'd never seen. They tried to paint it as an attack on tradition, on family and marriage...it was disgusting. The depths of hate and propaganda in this age astounded me. It still does."  



A thought occurred to her. _Are you gay, master?_  



Slash nearly fell over his own feet at _that_ question. "No, Kirlia, I'm not."  



_Then why do you believe that people of the same gender should be allowed to marry?_  



"You don't have to be gay to want everyone to be equal. And despite the horror stories of molestation and promiscuity that Jirachian politicians are prone to tell, especially when an election or fundraiser is coming up, I've never felt threatened by a gay guy in my life. No one's ever smacked my ass or molested me as a kid, so why the fuck should I have a problem with them? And as for marriage, honestly, if Jirachians don't think their marriages are strong enough to withstand the idea of gay people getting married, maybe their bonds aren't as sacred and powerful as they claim." Slash turned back and shot a glare at the church building before continuing. "If two people of the same sex are in love, who are others to judge? If they cannot have children, so what? Not like we don't have enough people in the world.""  



Kirlia's concern over the bitterness she was picking up faded a bit. He didn't just dislike them for believing something different...he disliked them for forcing those beliefs on others. That was something even she could understand.  



_Are all of them like that, master?_  



"No, but most of them are. The writings of their religion only have a small portion about homosexuality, but...well, it's a popular topic. Few things bring people together as much as a common source of misunderstanding and disgust. The most dangerous problem, though, is the nuttier branch of Jirachism that believes that they have to go a step further. Those guys are fanatics, take the lies and propaganda about gays too seriously, and have been known to harass, beat...and even, on occasion, kill people who are gay...or even people that they just suspect of it.  



Kirlia's eyes widened in shock and horror. Imposing beliefs on others was one thing, but to resort to violence against them? _That's awful! Master, how is it that they're allowed to have groupings like that church right out in the open?_  



"It's only a very small few who are that crazy. The 'official' stance of the Church is mere opposition, not violence. Still...it's a problem, and while it's caused by only a tiny proportion of Jirachians, it's still enough people to make it risky to be open about being gay. It's not as bad as it used to be, but...it's not exactly good, Kirlia. Even if I was gay, I might have looked around and made sure that we were out of earshot before telling you. Just to be careful."  



Slash glanced down at his Pokemon, sensing her surprise and anger at his words. He hesitated for a moment, trying to decide whether or not to continue talking about this. He knew that she had very little knowledge of the human world, and that some of its more unsavory aspects might frighten her. Still, it might be best for him to tell her the rest, especially since his team had ended up with a Corphish---something that might become a problem in the future.  



"I hate to tell you this, but there's more. The same kind of stigma that they have against gays goes for certain Pokemon, as well."  



_What do you mean?_  



"Dark-types...and those who use them. Jirachians view them as 'unclean'...some even considering them abominations."  



Slash could have sworn that he felt something strange in Kirlia's heart...a sort of "so what?" feeling that came to her instinctively...but she quickly buried it and he felt it no more. Considering that she was a Psychic type, he supposed that her initial reaction wasn't entirely surprising, even if it did seem a bit out-of-character for her affectionate personality.  



_...why?_, she finally asked.  



"I don't really know. Maybe it's because they're seen as more aggressive and dangerous than other Pokemon. Probably doesn't help that the Magmas and Aquas both use them a lot. But whatever the reason, it's highly frowned upon for a trainer to use Dark-types in Hoenn. In my entire life, I've met maybe half a dozen trainers who did, and all of them were treated...differently. Like they were untrustworthy. When they went shopping, store security always seemed to be following them. When they flirted, they always got the oh-no-he-could-be-a-crazy-person treatment. As for the Pokemon themselves...well, when a wild Taillow comes near people, they throw crumbs to them and laugh. When a Poochyena comes near, they throw rocks at them and yell at them to go away. A year or so ago, the Church tried to get the use of Dark-types banned. It didn't work, of course, but it's still a pretty popular opinion among them. "  



Kirlia didn't reply. She understood the fear of Dark types. How many times had her parents warned her to stay clear of Poochyena and Mightyena, regardless of what they were doing?  



"And just like with homosexuality, there are some loonies who take it a lot farther than mere hatred. There was this big thing a few years ago, where some Jirachians attacked a trainer and his Umbreon. The Pokemon was killed and the trainer was injured so badly that he could never walk again."  



_Why would they do such a thing?_  



"The people accused the Umbreon of being involved in certain accidents that had occurred shortly after the pair had arrived in town. There was no evidence that they did, but since there was no evidence leading to a human suspect...well, as modern as our society is supposed to be, there are still certain corners of it with people gullible and uneducated enough to believe that Dark-types are harbingers of ill will and bad luck. People often fear what they don't understand, and since Dark-types are perhaps the least-studied of all Pokemon types...stuff like that happens from time to time."  



Despite her own fears of Dark Pokemon, she had to agree. She could imagine the fear and frustration of being falsely accused, unable to explain that having power to cause harm and actually using it were different things...  



_It makes no sense. Why did they do such a thing? How can any beliefs be righteous and moral when they advocate murder?_  



"It's in their 'holy' writings. Most consider the laws about killing Dark types to be antiquated, but the nuttier minority uses those passages to justify their actions."  



_But...what logic could possibly let them think that those writings are right? I don't understand how it could ever get as bad as that!_  



"Neither do I. I think the problem is that they have been conditioned so strongly in their religion that they believe it is the only possible 'path'. They refuse to listen to other points of view...over time, devotion turns to arrogance...arrogance turns to discrimination...and discrimination turns to violence. The more widely-believed the issue, the more often violence becomes the end result. The killing of Dark-types is rare. Assaults on gay people are also rare, but far more common than with Dark Pokemon. Widely-loathed concepts such as humans having...relations...with Pokemon...those are extremely forbidden, almost always leading to violence and public outrage. Of course, most religions, not just Jirachism, are against _that_..."  



_Are you against...that? The...Pokemon thing?_  



Slash looked down at Kirlia, who was staring down at the street cobbles, cheeks colored a pale green. Feeling his own face flush a bit at this slightly awkward topic, he glanced around to make certain no one was in hearing distance before replying in a low voice.  



"Actually, Kirlia...I, uh...I see it like this. Pokemon are clearly sentient creatures, able to consent or turn down...advances...from people. Since they are capable of making a choice, I don't think it should be anyone's concern what humans and Pokemon...do." He felt his face redden another shade and tried (and failed) to shake it off. "That's not a very...popular opinion...and I would almost certainly lose my trainer license if I publicly advocated it...but that's how I feel."  



Kirlia looked up at her master, a little surprised at how strongly Slash felt. _You're very open-minded, master._  



"Thanks. I think that as long as all parties are of age, informed, and consenting, there should be no limits on love or...sex."  



Slash and Kirlia looked toward each other hesitantly, and immediately broke eye contact as soon as it was established, blushing furiously.  



"Do Pokemon have gods?" Slash asked, desperate to shift the subject away from sex, especially sex involving Pokemon and humans. Kirlia seemed likewise eager to change the topic; she was worried that her trainer would sense the funny feeling that the concept gave her.  



_Well, there are the Great Ones...Pokemon with amazing power over the world. All Pokemon have a sort of...instinctual knowledge of them. But they don't control the world, they just have a greater influence on it._  



Slash considered. "That's a bit different, I think. Many of the legendary Pokemon, some of which might be these Great Ones you're speaking of, have been seen at one point or another, documented by man. Jirachi has never been identified before. They just...believe in it based on old stories and writings. It's different from something like Zapdos or Lugia. Hell, there are actually videotapes of them."  



_That doesn't mean that Jirachi can't be real, just that it hasn't been seen by humans._  



"I suppose you're right. Still, I think it's silly to believe in something when there's no evidence of its existence. Besides, even if it did exist, it doesn't validate their religion, since most of the stories and rules were written and enforced by humans."  



Another curious thought came to Kirlia. _Master, why don't you follow Jirachism? You said that it was very common in Hoenn._  



"Well, my parents aren't Jirachian. I was brought up in an Atheist home, so I didn't really believe in anything. When I grew up, I got exposed to a lot of different religions and ideas, but none of them...connected with me. They all seemed kind of crazy, even the ones based on Pokemon that have been confirmed to exist, and Jirachism seemed to have a...hypocrisy...that turned me off from it even more. They preach about love and compassion, but it really only applies to those they agree with."  



Kirlia nodded in understanding, feeling more than a little relieved when they exited the town and left the church behind them. Religion was confusing. So many contradictions and assumptions...so easy to lead to close-minded hatred and violence...she could understand why her master believed it to be similar to Team Aqua. Their beliefs may have been different, but the paths were eerily similar, and both could lead to the same place---stubborn, self-righteous mindsets that turned against life...and even love.  



...love...  



Slash suddenly realized that Kirlia had stopped walking and looked like she was in deep thought and turned to her with a concerned gaze.  



"Kirlia? Is something wrong?"  



_Master...how does one know if they're in love?_  



Slash jumped a bit, startled at the seemingly random question. Kirlia looked up at him expectantly, curiosity flowing over their bond, tinged with a bit of worry and fear---understandable considering the discussion they just had. "Well...I'm not sure how it is for Pokemon, but for humans...well, honestly, I'm not totally sure on that, either. I've never really had a major relationship before."  



Swallowing nervously, Slash considered. He'd never really felt romantic attraction towards anyone before. Oh, he'd felt physical attraction...what sixteen year old didn't?...but never the sappy gooey love he'd heard about on television or from schoolmates.  



"Um...well, you see, people just get this...feeling that someone is special. It makes them feel...well, when you're in love, you're happy whenever you're around the other. Their presence alone makes you happy, sort of like a much stronger version of friendship."  



Kirlia nodded. _I think I understand...thank you, master._  



Slash smiled at her, glad the awkward moment was so thankfully brief. The two started walking down the trail again, hoping to make good time and get to Mauville before nightfall.  



His Pokemon, walking alongside him, smiled to herself, letting her thoughts be buoyed on the warmth of her new bond with Slash.  



_(love...)_, she wondered, blushing faintly.  



--- 



Archie backhanded the Aqua grunt across the face, hard. The unfortunate man fell to the ground, blood running from his nose.  



"What do you mean, killed? You told me that you expected no resistance!"  



"I'm sorry, boss, but---"  



The burly man reached down and roughly pulled him up to his feet. "Don't you ever apologize to me, because I don't give a damn about your excuses. What's done is done. So if you want me to spare your miserable life," he gestured to the Mightyena standing by his side, growling, ready to rip the grunt's throat out at Archie's command, "you will tell me exactly what happened."  



"It wasn't Team Magma, sir...it was one man..."  



"Maxie?"  



"No, sir. It was a tall man with black hair...we saw him leaving the museum after the grunts didn't report back. He had an Aggron and a Magmortar traveling with him..."  



Archie roughly released the grunt, walking back around his desk and sitting down, tapping the information into his computer. "No registered trainer in Hoenn matches that description, and no trainer from Kanto or Johto has come to this country with those Pokemon. Which means he's either a rogue trainer who does not have official certification, or he entered Hoenn illegally from one of the other countries."  



He stood up so fast that the Aqua backed up in blind panic, tripping over his own feet and falling onto his rear.  



"You have twenty-four hours to find out this bastard's name, or I'll feed you to the Sharpedo myself. Is that clear, maggot?"  



"Yes sir! Perfectly clear, sir!"  



"Then get the hell out of my sight."
